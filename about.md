My name is Crystal. Welcome to my blog! I created this blog because I found myself writing too much on Instagram and it wasn't the right place to share and capture all of my adventures! While this blog is mostly for myself, I hope you find my trip reports useful and fun to read too.

I was historically an Ultimate Frisbee athlete where I started in high school and played competitively for 20 years. During the latter years of my playing career, I wanted to find a different outlet. Some friends suggested that I try bouldering in an indoor gym and that's how I got into climbing.

I was never an outdoor person or anything. Despite growing up in west coast of Canada where there are plenty of mountains, I never went on a hike. Slowly over the years, I dabbled into different disciplines from bouldering, hiking, sport climbing, camping, snowboarding trad climbing, splitboarding, and etc... In recent years, I joined the Mountaineers, mountaineering club in Seattle out of complete randomness. I didn't know what I was getting into but somehow I met a bunch of new people, and somehow learned and linked a bunch of skills together.

Mountains are fun - it keeps me humble and honest always. There is always something to learn.

*Thank You for reading!*
