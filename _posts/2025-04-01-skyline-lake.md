Skyline Lake - This year, I've been lucky enough to get into a winter mountaineering course with the Mountaineers called "Winter Mountaineering Crevasse Rescue (WMCR)" and it's been challenging with many new skills involved. It's fast pace and physical & mentally demanding but it's humbling how much there is to learn. I wasn't sure last year if I wanted to or felt ready to take this course but given that there was a womens cohort, I applied and somehow got in!

Honestly, looking at the course description, I was intimidated too. There are many disciplines under the mountaineering umbrella, but as I've been diving deeper into a niche area, it gets more & more demanding physically and mentally. I'm very well aware that I'm also Crystal-sized and I do not move fast in comparison to bigger dudes. There's also the feeling of not being good enough on the climbing and ski/riding aspects. How often do you see a woman in splitmo?! I should be celebrating in being one.

There's so much to learn here such as winter traveling considerations, glacier travel, leading a rope team, building snow anchors, various crevasse rescue / haul systems (2:1, 3:1, 6:1), 2 person vs 3 people+ rope teams and etc... One thing I didn't consider at all is that there are various snow shelters options as well.

2 weekends ago, we went on a training skills day at Skyline Lake which is right across from Stevens Pass ski resort. I'm not ready to backcountry ski and so my mode of travel is my splitboard. Others were on skis or snowshoes and I was the only splitboarder. We got to practice various skills such as building snow anchors, building various types of snow shelters (ex: cave, tunnel, trench, tree well) and then finished the day off by building emergency sleds. The vibe being with an all-womens group is so different than having dudes around and it's been fun!

While splitmo (splitboarding mountaineering) isn't super efficient, it's been fun getting to ride my board. I started snowboarding about 6 years ago and I thought it was fun to pick up a new winter adrenaline sport. I somehow dabbled into touring with the splitboard and would have never guessed to really use my snowboarding skills as a means to get me somewhere up and down a mountain. I'm happy that my riding has gotten a lot better in recent years because in splitmo, I'm going to need to carry and ride with a 30-40lbs pack up and down the mountain and sometimes the terrain can get quite spicy. For example, the exit tracks can get tight and narrow and snow conditions are not guaranteed to be soft and slow. Riding with a heavy pack is interesting because heel turns get super fast and aggressive and toe turns are slow and sometimes feel non-responsive.
